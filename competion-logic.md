# How Competitions work in CopperHead

## Before Competion Starts

When the server is launched, the `arenas` option determines the number of players in the competion. The competion will not start until twice that number of players have joined.

Human or AI players, or a mixture of both, may join the server before the competition begins.

No player may join a competition after it begins. Players who disconnect during a competition automatically forfeit their matches.

## Round 1

In Round 1, players are paired at random to compete in matches. 

Each match is a series of games played according to the standard CopperHead rules. Winning a game awards one point, and the first player to reach the predefined number of points wins the match and advances to the next round.

## Round 2 and subsequent Rounds

In Round 2, winners from the prior round are paired at random to compete in new matches. If there are an odd number of players remaining, the player scoring the most points is awarded a "Bye" and automatically advances to the next round without competing in a match. In the case of a tie, the player who completes their prior round first is awarded the Bye. If there is still a tie, a coin flip determines who receives the Bye.

## Final Round

The final round is a single match between the last two remaining players. The winner of this match is declared the overall competition champion.

This concludes the competition. After a predefined delay, the server resets and begins accepting new players for a new competition.
